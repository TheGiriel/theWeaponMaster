# The Arsenal
The linchpin Relic of this mod: the Arsenal allows you to exchange your currently equipped weapon, by removing the old Legendary Weapon cards from your deck and adding new ones. However, every time you attack, your _Vicious_ counter increases! For every 5 Vicious you have, you deal and take 1 extra damage on attacks.  
While it may seem alluring, be careful that you don't bite off more than you can chew!
## Legendary Weapons:  
__25 cards: 19 Attacks, 6 Skills__  
These versatile cards can offer you everything you need, but in return, they cannot be upgraded unless you own their respective upgrade Relics.  
### Fenrir (Upgrade Relic: _Splintering Steel_)  
These cards _Evolve_ and grow stronger the longer you fight! Make your enemies permanently bleed out with _Lacerate_, steal their Block or even mercilessly attack them all in an onslaught of attacks - Everything is possible!  
### Cerberus (Upgrade Relic: _Hellhound Oil_)  
Let this sharp edge _Flash_ by discarding cards to empower your attacks, and if you discard enough you even get to activate special effects such as extra card draws, stronger attacks the longer you wait or possibly even power stealing!  
### Revenant Cleaver (Upgrade Relic: _Ghoulskin Sheath_)  
Cleverly use this card's _Hunger_ to improve its effects or gain a bit of Temporary HP when it's _Sated_. Heal, gain temporary HP or even increase your max HP, but be wary, many of its effects only last for one turn!  
### Atropos' Shears (Upgrade Relic: _Mana Whetstone_)  
A versatile set of cards that allow you to inflict the dangerous _Mana Burn_ debuff! _Ignite_ the debuff when you attack, split and delay damage or even force an enemy to attack a random opponent, the Shears have something for everyone!  
### Leviathan Gauntlet (Upgrade Relic: _Shockwave Modulator_)  
Destroy defensive enemies and _Stagger_ them with this powerful Gauntlet! Gain _Charges_ every turn, to power up special abilities, such as dealing HP loss damage to blocking enemies, punch through all defending enemies or cause a shockwave that ignores Thorns!  
  
# The Bully   
__15 cards: 5 Attacks, 7 Skills, 3 Powers__  
"Crowd Control" via intent manipulation and debuffs. _Taunt_ your enemies into attacking you or _Intimidate_ them into defending, all the while you keep applying more and more debuffs on them. But be careful, Bully cards exhaust quickly and increase your Vicious counter even more than others!  
While these cards are powerful and often give you an extra turn of breathing room, you cannot play _Intimidate_ or _Taunt_ cards, if none of your opponents are attacking or defending respectively.

# The Revolver (Support relic: _Heavy Drum_)  
__15 cards -> 10 Attacks, 4 Skills, 1 Power__   
This relic allows you to use six _Ammo_ cards before you have to _Reload_, allowing you to return the three bottom cards of your discard pile and drawing one card - but you don't deal damage with the reloading Ammo card!
The support cards allow you to _Reload_ prematurely, scale _Ammo_ cards with Dexterity or even exhaust one card to deal increased damage to the first target, while dealing collateral damage to the one behind it!  

# The Generics  
__20 cards -> 3 Attacks, 12 Skills, 5 Powers__  
These last 20 cards finish off the character's pool and give you extra options for both damage and survivability, with a few buffs, debuffs and card manipulation sprinkled in - two of these cards even come in a double pack: Bob and Weave, as well as Relax and Recollect are two defense-oriented cards that switch effects after being played!
