# theWeaponMaster
sts mod, do the pew pews and stab stabs.

Card Archetypes:  
Legendary Weapon: Special weapons that can be exchanged at will (once per turn)- fully implemented, all with special mechanics.
Bully: Be a jerk to enemies to debuff them and force actions - increase vicious.
Revolver: lots of pew pew, reload after a few shots.
Generic cards: Whatever else the character uses that isn't big enough for its own archetype (i.e. 15+ cards).
